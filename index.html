        <h3>Jamaican Runner <br />Born: August 21 1986</h3>

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Usain Bolt, in full Usain St. Leo Bolt, (born August 21, 1986, Montego
          Bay, Jamaica),Jamaican sprinter who won gold medals in the 100-metre
          and 200-metre races in an unprecedented three straight Olympic Games
          and is widely considered the greatest sprinter of all time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bolt, the son of grocers in Jamaica’s rural Trelawny parish, excelled
          as a cricket fast bowler in his preteenyears. He developed a deep
          affection for the European football (soccer) teams Real Madrid and
          Manchester United,but his school coaches steered him toward track and
          field.<br />
          An eleven-time World Champion, he won consecutive World Championship
          100 m, 200 m and 4 × 100 metres relay gold medals from 2009 to 2015,
          with the exception of a 100 m false start in 2011.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is the most successful male athlete of the World Championships.
          Bolt is the first athlete to win four World Championship titles in the
          200 m and is one of the most successful in the 100 m with three
          titles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bolt improved upon his second 100 m world record of 9.69 with 9.58
          seconds in 2009 – the biggest improvement since the start of
          electronic timing. He has twice broken the 200 metres world record,
          setting 19.30 in 2008 and 19.19 in 2009.
